**Paper:** *VGGTFace: Topologically Consistent Facial Geometry Reconstruction in the Wild* (AAAI26)

VGGTFace is a system for reconstructing a topologically consistent 3D facial mesh from 16 multi-view face images captured in the wild in less than 10 seconds.

> 🚧 **Code Release:** We are preparing the open-source release.  
> In the meantime, you can try the public demo below.

## 🔗 Online Demo

Try VGGTFace in your browser (upload 16 images → reconstruct a mesh in one click)!

- **Gradio Demo:** https://uu31763-ba3f-b060fff2.westc.gpuhub.com:8443/

> **Note:** The current web demo supports **exactly 16 images** per reconstruction.

## 📌 Notes

- The demo currently reloads some components per run, so inference may be slow. We are working on optimizing it.
